# AI Course Project Tracks

## Overview and Introduction
The course project is a significant component of this course, designed to provide you with a hands-on opportunity to delve deeply into an area of AI/ML that excites you. It is your chance to apply the theoretical concepts from lectures to a substantial, practical challenge.  

While discussing with fellow classmates about your project is encouraged, this project should be done individually and will be graded individually.  

To accommodate a wide range of interests and career goals—from fundamental research to applied engineering—we offer three distinct project tracks. Whether you’re passionate about verifying scientific claims, building real-world applications, or pushing the boundaries of research, there’s a track for you.  

| Feature         | TinyReproductions | ProductPrototype | NovelResearch |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------|---------------|
| Primary Goal    | Verify a known claim | Solve a real problem | Propose a new claim |
| Core Challenge  | Simplification & Distillation | System Integration & Design | Novelty & Rigor |
| Focus           | Scientific Insight | Engineering Application | Research Contribution |
| Paper Reading   | Deep dive into one paper | Broad search for applicable tools | Deep dive into a subfield |
| Ideal Outcome   | An educational demo | A functional prototype | A submittable workshop paper |

## Deliverables & Evaluation
All projects, regardless of the track, must submit the following:

1. **Project Report (PDF + LaTeX Source)**  
   A 4–6 page report using the official ICLR paper style.  

2. **Code (ZIP File)**  
   A zip file containing all code with a clear README.md explaining structure, dependencies, instructions to run, and attribution of code.  

3. **Demo Video (5 minutes)**  
   A presentation summarizing your project with track-specific guidelines.  

4. **Poster (PDF)**  
   A poster summarizing the project in the BetterPoster format.  

Submissions must be anonymous (except the 5-min video voice). No names, student IDs, or personal information in report, code, or poster.

# Track 1: TinyReproductions – The Art of Scientific Distillation
**Goal:** Distill and verify the core insights of a significant research paper with small-scale experiments.  

### Required Components
- Paper selection (impactful, testable claim, accessible baselines)  
- Hypothesis distillation  
- Minimalist experimental design  
- Faithful implementation with baseline(s)  
- Analysis of results  

### Example Projects
- Vision: WGAN vs GAN on MNIST/Fashion-MNIST  
- NLP: Ablations from *Attention Is All You Need*  
- RL: PPO vs A2C on OpenAI Gym classic control  

### Deliverables
Report structured as a reproduction study; demo video compares reproduced vs. original figures.  

### Evaluation Criteria
- Rigor & experimental design  
- Implementation & reproducibility  
- Analysis & report clarity  
- Poster & video effectiveness

# Track 2: ProductPrototype – From Problem to Prototype
**Goal:** Identify a real-world problem and engineer an AI-powered prototype.  

### Required Components
- Problem definition & target user  
- User requirements & success criteria  
- Literature review & technology selection  
- System design & architecture plan  
- Prototype implementation  

### Example Projects
- Automated RF signal classifier (ECE comms)  
- Smart grid load forecaster (ECE power)  
- GitHub issue triage bot (software engineering)  

### Deliverables
Report emphasizes problem definition, system design, and evaluation against user needs. Demo video is a screencast of the prototype. Poster highlights problem & solution.  

### Evaluation Criteria
- Problem definition & user focus  
- System design & engineering execution  
- Written report & justification  
- Poster & demo clarity

# Track 3: NovelResearch – The First Step Towards Discovery
**Goal:** Conduct original research: identify a gap, propose a novel hypothesis, and test it.  

### Required Components
- Literature review to identify a gap  
- Hypothesis & contributions  
- Proposed method  
- Experimental design  
- Implementation & experimentation  

### Example Projects
- New data augmentation for time-series  
- Empirical study on reasoning failures in LLMs  
- Modified loss function for robustness to noise  

### Deliverables
Report structured as a formal research paper (Abstract, Intro, Related Work, Method, Experiments, Conclusion). Demo video is a conference-style oral presentation.  

### Evaluation Criteria
- Novelty & problem formulation  
- Methodology & rigor  
- Written paper clarity & persuasiveness  
- Poster & video professionalism
