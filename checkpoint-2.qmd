## 1) Updated Problem Statement & Goal {.smaller}

**Problem:** AI assistants struggle with domain-specific knowledge from specialized sources like company documents or class notes, performing well on general web data but failing on targeted corpora.

**Updated Goal:** Implement SimRAG's two-stage self-improving methodology to achieve measurable improvements over vanilla RAG on constrained hardware (single RTX 3080).

**Key Refinements Since CP1:**
- **Focus Shift:** From reproduction to implementation of core SimRAG methodology
- **Hardware Optimization:** Implemented QLoRA-based efficient fine-tuning for single-GPU constraints
- **Versioning System:** Added model registry for tracking Stage I and Stage II training phases

**Hypothesis:** SimRAG's self-training approach can achieve +2-3% Recall@k improvements even with hardware constraints through efficient fine-tuning and synthetic QA generation.

---

## 2) Updated Methodology & Progress {.smaller}

**Technical Approach:** Implement SimRAG's self-training methodology with:
- **Stage I:** Fine-tune LLM on instruction-following, QA, and search data using QLoRA
- **Stage II:** Generate synthetic domain QA pairs from unlabeled corpora, then fine-tune on these examples
- **Baseline:** Vanilla RAG with dense retriever + 7-8B LLM
- **Target:** 5k-20k document corpus with +2-3% Recall@k or EM/F1 gains

**Progress Since CP1:**
- **Model Tuning Infrastructure:** Implemented versioned fine-tuning with hardware optimization
- **Training Framework:** Added QLoRA support for efficient single-GPU training
- **Version Management:** Created model registry system for tracking training phases
- **In Progress:** Stage I implementation with instruction-following datasets
- **Next:** Synthetic QA generation and Stage II fine-tuning

## 3) Code Snippet 1: SimRAG Stage I Implementation {.smaller}

```python
class InstructionFollowing(SimRAGBase):
    """SimRAG Stage 1: Instruction-following fine-tuning"""
    
    def prepare_instruction_data(self, use_real_datasets: bool = True):
        """Prepare instruction-following data for Stage 1"""
        if use_real_datasets:
            return self.load_instruction_datasets(["alpaca"])
        else:
            return self._generate_test_instruction_data()
    
    def train_stage_1(self, notes: str = "SimRAG Stage 1"):
        """Train Stage 1: Instruction-following fine-tuning"""
        instruction_data = self.prepare_instruction_data()
        self.load_model()
        train_dataset = self.prepare_training_data(instruction_data)
        output_dir = f"./tuned_models/llama_1b/stage_1"
        self.setup_trainer(train_dataset, output_dir, 
                          num_epochs=self.config.simrag_stage_1_epochs)
        return self.train_model(notes=notes)
```

## 4) Explanation of Snippet 1 {.smaller}

**Function:** Implements SimRAG Stage I - instruction-following fine-tuning using the `InstructionFollowing` class that extends `SimRAGBase`.

**Key Components:**
- `prepare_instruction_data()`: Loads instruction-following datasets (with fallback to test data)
- `train_stage_1()`: Orchestrates the complete Stage I training pipeline with versioning
- Integration with `BasicTuner` for actual fine-tuning and model registry for version tracking

**Importance:** This is the foundation of SimRAG's self-improvement loop. Stage I teaches the model to better follow instructions and answer questions, preparing it for Stage II's domain-specific adaptation. The versioning system tracks this as a distinct training phase, and the infrastructure is ready for execution.

## 5) Code Snippet 2: Synthetic QA Generation {.smaller}

```python
class SyntheticQAGeneration(SimRAGBase):
    """SimRAG Stage 2: Synthetic QA generation from domain documents"""
    def generate_questions_from_document(self, document: str, num_questions: int = 3):
        """Generate questions from a single document using LLM"""
        prompt = f"""Given this document, generate {num_questions} diverse questions:
Document: {document[:500]}...
Generate questions that cover key concepts, processes, and applications.
Questions:"""
        response = self.gateway.chat(prompt)
        return self._parse_questions(response)
    
    def create_qa_pairs_from_documents(self, documents, questions_per_doc: int = 2):
        """Create synthetic QA pairs from a list of documents"""
        qa_pairs = []
        for doc in documents:
            questions = self.generate_questions_from_document(doc, questions_per_doc)
            for q in questions:
                answer, context_docs, context_scores = self.rag_system.query(q)
                qa_pairs.append({"question": q, "answer": answer, "context": doc[:200], "context_scores": context_scores})
        return qa_pairs
```

## 6) Explanation of Snippet 2 {.smaller}

**Function:** Generates synthetic question-answer pairs from domain documents for SimRAG Stage II training using the `SyntheticQAGeneration` class.

**Key Features:**
- `generate_questions_from_document()`: Uses LLM gateway to create diverse questions from documents
- `create_qa_pairs_from_documents()`: Processes multiple documents and combines generated questions with RAG-generated answers
- Quality tracking via context scores for filtering high-quality pairs
- Integration with existing RAG system (`BasicRAG`) for answer generation

**Importance:** This enables SimRAG's self-improvement by creating domain-specific training data without manual labeling. The synthetic QA pairs will be used in Stage II to fine-tune the model on domain-specific knowledge, completing the self-training loop. The infrastructure is implemented and ready for execution.

## 8) Result Analysis & Next Steps {.smaller}

**Analysis:** The complete SimRAG infrastructure is implemented and ready for execution. All core components (Stage I, Stage II, versioning, tuning) are in place. The next step is to run actual training experiments to validate the methodology and measure improvements.

**Immediate Next Steps:**

1. **Execute Stage I Training:** Run `InstructionFollowing.train_stage_1()` on instruction-following datasets to create baseline tuned model

2. **Generate Synthetic Dataset:** Use `SyntheticQAGeneration.generate_synthetic_dataset()` on document corpus to create Stage II training data

3. **Execute Stage II Training:** Fine-tune Stage I model on synthetic QA pairs using quality-filtered examples

4. **Performance Comparison:** Evaluate tuned vs baseline RAG on domain-specific queries (Recall@k, EM/F1)

5. **Results Analysis:** Measure and report improvements, validate SimRAG's self-improvement claims

**Decision Point:** Infrastructure complete. Ready to execute training runs to obtain empirical results comparing tuned vs baseline RAG performance.
