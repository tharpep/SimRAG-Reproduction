# Project Checkpoint 2: Student Implementation & New Results

This second checkpoint builds on your initial work from Checkpoint 1. The goal is to demonstrate significant progress
in your core implementation, show that you are actively writing code, and present a new result that moves your project
forward. This assignment will require you to update your project context, showcase student-written code, and analyze
your findings since the first checkpoint.

> Note: It is okay to change project direction or goals between Checkpoint 1 and Checkpoint 2, but you must clearly explain
any such changes in your submission.

This assignment requires you to submit an **8-slide presentation in Quarto markdown.**

---

## **1. Content Requirements**

Your submission will consist of **three parts spread across eight slides.**

### **Part 1: Updated Project Context (2 slides)**

#### **Slide 1: Updated Problem Statement & Goal**
- Concisely restate your project’s core problem.  
- Clearly state the primary goal or hypothesis. Highlight any changes or refinements to your goal since Checkpoint 1.

#### **Slide 2: Updated Methodology & Progress**
- Briefly describe your proposed technical approach.  
- Explain your progress since Checkpoint 1 and note any changes to your planned model, algorithm, or system design.

---

### **Part 2: Core Code Implementation (4 slides)**

This section is meant to demonstrate your **coding progress.** The code shown must be **written by you.**
While you may get help from LLMs, this should not be code copied from an external repository.
It should represent a **core part of your project** (e.g., model architecture, methodology, dataset code, demo code, or experiment setup).

#### **Slide 3: Code Snippet 1**
- Show a particularly interesting or important part of your student-written code.  
- Strict limit of **20 code lines.**

#### **Slide 4: Explanation of Snippet 1**
- Explain what the code on the previous slide does.  
- Justify why this is a key component of your project.

#### **Slide 5: Code Snippet 2**
- Show a second, different student-written code snippet.  
- Strict limit of **20 code lines.**

#### **Slide 6: Explanation of Snippet 2**
- Explain the function and importance of the second code snippet.

---

### **Part 3: New Result & Analysis (2 slides)**

This section is for sharing a **new result from running your code.**

#### **Slide 7: New Preliminary Result**
- Present a new result obtained since Checkpoint 1.  
- This must be a step beyond your initial finding.
- This can be a comparative result (e.g., method vs baseline), a new figure, a more complete demo, or a results table.

#### **Slide 8: Result Analysis & Next Steps**
- Briefly explain what this new result means.  
- How does it compare to your expectations, the baseline, or the original paper’s claims?
- Describe your **immediate next steps** for the project based on this result.

> **Note on “No Results”**  
> This checkpoint requires a *tangible result* to be considered satisfactory.  
> If you were unable to get a new result, Slide 7 must instead show the primary roadblock (e.g., error message, failed experiment).  
> Slide 8 must then provide a *highly detailed* explanation of your debugging process, what you tried, and your plan.  
> Submissions without a new result cannot score higher than “Okay (2)” on the “Results & Analysis” criterion.

## **2. Rubric for Grading**

Your checkpoint will be graded according to the four equally weighted criteria below.

| **Criterion** | **Excellent (5)** | **Good (4)** | **Satisfactory (3)** | **Okay (2)** | **Poor (1)** |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|----------------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Updated Project Context** | The summary is exceptionally clear. Updates and progress since CP1 are explicitly and concisely stated. The project’s goal and method are immediately understood. | The summary is clear and establishes context well. Updates since CP1 are mentioned. | The summary is present but may be slightly unclear. Updates since CP1 are vague or missing. | The summary is confusing, incomplete, or a simple copy/paste from CP1. | The context is missing or nonsensical. |
| **Code Snippet 1 & Explanation** | Highly relevant, clearly student-written, and shows progress on a core component. Explanation is crisp and demonstrates strong understanding. | Relevant and appears student-written. Explanation connects clearly to goals. | Somewhat relevant and plausibly student-written, but explanation is superficial / code trivial. | Irrelevant, confusing, or appears copied. Explanation is poor or missing. | No code provided, or trivial / unexplained. |
| **Code Snippet 2 & Explanation** | Highly relevant, clearly student-written, and shows progress on a different core component. Explanation is crisp and demonstrates understanding. | Relevant and appears student-written. Explanation connects clearly to goals. | Somewhat relevant and plausibly student-written, but explanation is superficial / code trivial. | Irrelevant, confusing, or appears copied. Explanation is poor or missing. | No code provided, or trivial / unexplained. |
| **Results & Analysis** | Clear, new result with thoughtful, deep analysis. Next steps are concrete and logically build on the result. | New result with clear explanation and logical next steps. | New result present but analysis superficial or next steps vague. | Result unclear or missing, but detailed debugging explanation provided. | No new result or good-faith effort shown. |
