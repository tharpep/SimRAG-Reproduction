    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Run This Notebook**\n",
    "1. Upload `documents.zip` (when prompted)\n",
    "2. Notebook automatically runs baseline tests (base model, no fine-tuning)\n",
    "3. Upload your model ZIP (e.g., `checkpoint-1000-fixed.zip`)\n",
    "4. Notebook automatically runs fine-tuned model tests\n",
    "5. Automatic comparison and download\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: View Results Locally**\n",
    "1. Download the `comparison_results_*.json` file from Colab\n",
    "2. Place it in: `comparison_results/` (project root)\n",

    "**Answer Quality Score**: Multi-metric evaluation (0.0-1.0)\n",

    "- **Context Relevance**: Word overlap between answer and retrieved context\n",
    "- **Question Relevance**: Word overlap between answer and question\n",
    "- **Not Refusal**: Answer attempts to respond (not \"I don't know\")\n",
